"This is a modern e-commerce web application built with React.js, featuring a complete shopping experience. The application includes user authentication with token-based login, a product listing page displaying items in a responsive card grid layout, shopping cart functionality with add/remove/quantity management, and order history tracking. The project uses React Router for navigation, Context API for global authentication state, localStorage for token persistence, and react-hot-toast for user notifications. The design follows modern e-commerce principles with a professional blue color scheme, card-based layouts, gradient backgrounds, and smooth animations using Framer Motion. Mock data is used for development with the structure ready for API integration. Key features include responsive design, loading states, error handling, and a clean navigation system. The application is built with Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and uses Lucide React for icons.\\n\\n**Last changes:** Initial project setup with complete authentication flow, product listing, cart management, order history, and all necessary components and utilities."
